% \comm{i have made a macro to include comments in the text that will come up red with an identifier at the start (like this), the first digit being for the chapter and the 2nd digit being which number comment it is in the chapter --- i did it like this so that it would be easier to just use $\backslash$renewcommand to get rid of them all quickly, and hopefully it will just make refering to specific parts a bit easier or whatever\\[2cm]}

% \comm{so far, most of this is just straight dumps from the papers we've written. {\color{Blue}The stuff that is just dumped will be in blue}, so that it is easier to identify. It took me a while to get properly started because it was pretty overwhelming, but filling out sections with related stuff that has been done previously has helped make it seem less daunting so progress should be quicker now.\\[2cm]}

% \comm{each chapter and section has a comment written about it to give an idea of what will go there, followed by the relevant stuff from the papers.. I have started working properly on chapter 3 as well, working on the theory ideas and definitions that we were talking about a while ago\\[2cm]}

% \comm{i havent sorted out all my references from everything in a~.bib file yet, so i just used the ones from gecco 19 as a placeholder}
